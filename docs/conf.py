# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------
import os
import sys
import sphinx_rtd_theme # pip3 install sphinx_rtd_theme

# Edit path so all modules can be found
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('..'))

sys.path.append('../../xeryon_library')

# -- Additional modules ------------------------------------------------------
# `autodoc_mock_imports` includes list of modules used in the project which are
# not included. This list is required for successfull build by readthedocs.
# Including `numpy` into the list generates error message.
# `pypylon` must be included here as it cannot be installed from the
# requirements.txt because it generates some error with wheels.
# Including `Xeryon` in the list is required as long as this library is not
# published within the project.
